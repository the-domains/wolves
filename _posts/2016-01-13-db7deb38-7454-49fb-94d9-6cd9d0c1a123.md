I applied to a job on craigslist the other day for a tutoring position. It looked a little hippy, but I didn't care much. However, the following is result:

**Hippy Tutor Recruiter: **

"Hi WolVes,

Thank you for reaching out. I have just looked over your resume and wonder whether you practice meditation, yoga, or any other contemplative tradition. You may have seen on our list of requirements that we do seek that in prospective tutors. We are only interviewing those applicants that have specifically demonstrate self-awareness, present-moment awareness and mindfulness as it is foundational to our mission and the service we are providing. 

Thank you,

Danielle"

**My Response: **

"Hello Danielle, 

You require yoga or meditation experience to tutor under the pretenses of open mindedness? The answer is no I do not follow a praxis of open-mindedness. However, having lived with Buddhist monks, I can confidently say that the monks would also find this very idea silly, egotistical, and, as you would probably say, "closed-minded".

Cheers,

WolVes". 

Sorry, I don't have time for your Sweat Yoga class malarkey. I have math to do and noobs to kill. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/35c37d47-0405-421a-9325-b4cb354c3469.jpg)
